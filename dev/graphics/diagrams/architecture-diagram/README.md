The system overview diagram in [dibs-architecture.graffle](dibs-architecture.graffle) was created by Michael Hucka in 2021, using OmniGraffle Pro 7.18.5  on a macOS 10.4.6 computer. The SVG version in [dibs-architecture.svg](dibs-architecture.svg) was produced using the following steps:

1. Export from OmniGraffle to SVG format, using the options "transparent background" and `0`inch margin. (See screen image at the right.)
2. Run [svg-buddy](https://github.com/phauer/svg-buddy) on the SVG file produced from step #1. This will embed the fonts used in the SVG file, overcoming a limitation of OmniGraffle's SVG output. The following is the command line used:
    ```sh
    java -jar svg-buddy.jar dibs-architecture.svg
    ```
