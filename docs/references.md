They host a regular forum and provide links to resources about CDL.
* [Project ReShare](https://projectreshare.org/about/) is a group of libraries, consortia, information organizations, and developers, with both commercial and non-commercial interests working on implementing new and open approaches to library resource sharing.

* The [CDL Information & Recommendation Cooperative (CIRC)](https://www.cdlproject.org) is a group of library professionals working to discover and evaluate potential tools and solutions for CDL.

Caltech's DIBS is not the only CDL implementation, nor is it the first. The following are others that the developers of DIBS are aware of:

* The [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) is an open library catalog and digital lending system implemented by the Internet Archive. The [source code is available from GitHub](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/).
* Princeton University Library has implemented CDL using [Figgy](https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy), an open-source digital repository application [they developed](https://library.princeton.edu/digital-collections/digital-pul/technology).  Like DIBS, it uses IIIF and the Universal Viewer.
* Fordham University developed [G-CDL](https://github.com/Fordham-University-Libraries/G-CDL), an open-source CDL system that uses Google Drive as its backend.
* [Alma Digital](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/blog/controlled-digital-lending-with-existing-tools-in-the-toolbox-alma-digital/) is a commercial repository system that's part of [ExLibris Alma](https://exlibrisgroup.com/products/alma-library-services-platform/). It supports digital lending, including control on number of concurrent users, cooling-off periods, and more.
* DLSG's [Directed Lending Solution](https://www.dlsg.com) is another commercial system for digital lending.
