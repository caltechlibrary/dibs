* In September, the non-profit [Library Futures Foundation](https://www.libraryfutures.net) released a policy document titled [Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential](https://www.libraryfutures.net/policy-document-2021). The document _"expands beyond the legal rationale laid out in the Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) White Paper by clarifying the core principles that are the foundations of a library’s mission to provide access to materials to serve the public good. "_

* The [Controlled Digital Lending Implementers](https://sites.google.com/view/cdl-implementers) is a forum [organized in April 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/cdl-implementers/about-cdli?authuser=0) by a group of libraries and people interested in implementing controlled digital lending services. They host a regular forum and provide links to resources about CDL.

* [Project ReShare](https://projectreshare.org/about/) is a group of libraries, consortia, information organizations, and developers, with both commercial and non-commercial interests working on implementing new and open approaches to library resource sharing. The [ReShare Community Charter](https://projectreshare.org/about/community-charter/) provides more details about the goals of the effort.

* In June 2021, the [International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions](https://www.ifla.org) issued a [statement on Controlled Digital Lending](https://www.ifla.org/publications/ifla-statement-on-controlled-digital-lending/) in support of CDL as a means of enabling libraries to fulfil their missions.

Caltech's DIBS is not the only CDL implementation, nor is it the first. The following are others that the developers of DIBS are aware of:

* The [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) is an open library catalog and digital lending system implemented by the Internet Archive. The [source code is available from GitHub](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/).

* Princeton University Library has implemented CDL using [Figgy](https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy), an open-source digital repository application [they developed](https://library.princeton.edu/digital-collections/digital-pul/technology).  Like DIBS, it uses IIIF and the Universal Viewer.

* Fordham University developed [G-CDL](https://github.com/Fordham-University-Libraries/G-CDL), an open-source CDL system that uses Google Drive as its backend.

* [Alma Digital](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/blog/controlled-digital-lending-with-existing-tools-in-the-toolbox-alma-digital/) is a commercial repository system that's part of [ExLibris Alma](https://exlibrisgroup.com/products/alma-library-services-platform/). It supports digital lending, including control on number of concurrent users, cooling-off periods, and more.

* DLSG's [Directed Lending Solution](https://www.dlsg.com) is another commercial system for digital lending.
