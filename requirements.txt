# Note: mod_wsgi is only needed by run-server. You can comment it out if you
# are not using run-server and you run into problems installing it on your
# system. (Tip: on Ubuntu 20, mod_wsgi won't install without the apache2-dev
# library on the system. If you get an error about "apxs" missing, try doing
# `sudo apt install apache2-dev` and then try pip install mod_wsgi again.)
