# Note: as of version 4.0, flake8 does NOT read global configuration files

# own, and you're looking at this config file and wondering how the two will
# interaction, the answer is simple: they won't.  Only this file matters.

# The following flake8 plugins are assumed to be installed:
#   flake8-bugbear
#   flake8-builtins

    # We try to stick to 80 chars but don't want to be hung up on it.
    E501,
    # We prefer two lines between methods of a class.

    # Sometimes we want to align keywords, and these rules run counter to it.

    # In some situations, it's more readable to omit spaces around operators
    # and colons.

    # According to Flake8 docs at https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html
    # line breaks *should* come before a binary operator, but as of version 4,
    # Flake8 still flags the breaks as bad. So:

per-file-ignores =
    # The plac.annotations lines contain hand-aligned text, which triggers
