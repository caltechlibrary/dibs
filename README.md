## Introduction

DIBS is a web-based system that enables members of Caltech to borrow materials that are not otherwise available in e-book or other electronic formats.  The system was developed in the year 2021 to help Caltech students and faculty continue their studies and work during the global [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Access to content in Caltech's live DIBS server is limited to members of Caltech, but the software for DIBS itself is open-sourced under a BSD type license.

The concept of [controlled digital lending](https://controlleddigitallending.org/faq) (CDL) is to allow libraries to loan items to digital patrons in a "lend like print" fashion.  It is the digital equivalent of traditional library lending. Libraries digitize a physical item from their collection, then lend out a secured digital version to one user at a time while the original, printed copy is simultaneously marked as unavailable. The number of digital copies of an item allowed to be loaned at any given time is strictly controlled to match the number of physical print copies taken off the shelves, to ensure an exact "owned-to-loaned" ratio.

DIBS provides two main components of a CDL system: a loan tracking system, and an integrated digital content viewing interface.  DIBS embeds the [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io) to display materials that comply with the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF).

## Requirements

The core DIBS server is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and makes use of some additional Python software libraries that are installed automatically during the [installation step](#installation) steps.

### _Requirements to run a demo_

Although DIBS relies on the existence of a IIIF image server (and content to serve), for initial exploration and demonstration purposes, you don't need to set up an IIIF server; you can reference content located in any of a number of publicly-accessible IIIF servers around the world, and DIBS includes a sample [IIIF manifest](https://iiif.io/explainers/using_iiif_resources/#iiif-manifest) as an example of that.  Beyond this, you shouldn't need anything else to run the DIBS demo. (If that's not the case, please [report the problem](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs/issues).)


### _Requirements to use DIBS for real use at another institution_

In order to use DIBS at another institution (other than [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu)), certain additional things are needed. 

1. A **IIIF server**. At Caltech, we use a serverless component running on an Amazon cloud instance, but [many other IIIF server options exist](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif#image-servers). If you're looking at DIBS, presumably it means you want to serve content that is not freely available in a public IIIF server, which means you will need to set up a server of your own.
2. A **web server** to host DIBS.  The current version of DIBS has only been tested with Apache2 on Linux (specifically, Ubuntu 20) and macOS (specifically 10.13, High Sierra). DIBS comes with a WSGI adapter file and sample config file for Apache, but it should be possible to run DIBS in other WSGI-compliant servers.
3. An **authentication layer**. For authentication, DIBS assumes that the web server takes care of user authentication in such a way that DIBS is behind the authentication layer and all users who can reach the DIBS pages are allowed to view content. DIBS only implements checks to distinguish between regular users versus staff who are allowed to access restricted pages. For the authentication layer, at Caltech we use the [Shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_Single_Sign-on_architecture) single sign-on system, but it is possible to use other schemes.  The installation and configuration of a single sign-on system depends on the specifics of a given institution, and are not described here.
4. Modification to the metadata retrieval code. We strove to limit dependencies on external systems, but the interface for staff to add items to DIBS requires looking up some limited metadata based on an item's barcode, and lacking a universal scheme or ILS interface to do that, we had to hard code the access. Thankfully, this is limited to just a few lines in  [`server.py`](dibs/server.py). We currently use TIND at Caltech, so unless you also use TIND, you will need to modify the TIND-specific lines in that file.
5. Modification to the HTML templates to change the branding. The template files in [`dibs/templates`](dibs/templates) are specific to Caltech, and will need to be edited to suit another installation. (We are open to making the branding customization easier and would welcome a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for suitable changes!)


## Installation

To use DIBS, currently you must get a copy of the source code from this repository and then run DIBS from your copy of the source directory .


### ⓵ _Get the DIBS source code_

There are several ways of getting the latest release of the DIBS source code. Here is one of the simplest:

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs/releases) in the GitHub repository for DIBS.
2. Find the latest release there (normally the first one on the page). <img align="right" width="225px" src="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs/raw/main/.graphics/assets.png"/>
3. Find the **Assets** section of the release.
4. Click on the link titled **Source code** (zip); it will be downloaded.
5. Unzip the file.

The result will be a subdirectory named `dibs`, which contains the source code.

### ⓶ _Install Python dependencies_

Next, install the Python dependencies on your system or your virtual environment:

```sh
cd dibs
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That is all you should need to run a demo of DIBS on a Linux or macOS system.  As mentioned above, if you plan on deploying DIBS at another institution, you will also need to install and configure Apache, an authentication system running in conjunction with the Apache server, a IIIF server of some kind, and finally, make some changes to DIBS itself to adapt it for your environment.


## Usage: running a server locally for demo/development

For demonstration purposes as well as development, it's convenient to run DIBS on your local machine.  The following instructions describe the process, assuming that DIBS has never been configured or run on your system.


### ⓵ _Copy the sample `settings.ini` configuration file_

The file `settings.ini-example` is a sample configuration file for DIBS.  Copy the file to `settings.ini`,

```sh
cp settings.ini-example settings.ini
```

and edit its contents in a text editor to suit your local installation.


### ⓶ _Load a sample book into DIBS_

Prior to starting the DIBS server for the first time, for testing purposes, you may want to add some sample data. This can be done by running the script [`load-mock-data.py`](load-mock-data.py):

```sh
python3 load-mock-data.py
```


### ⓷ _Load a sample user into DIBS_

The program [`people-manager`](people-manager) is an interface for adding user and role information.  To be able to manage DIBS content, create at least one user with a role of "library".  Suppose you want to name your sample user "dibsuser", then you could run the following command:

```sh
./people-manager add role="library" uname=dibsuser
```


### ⓸ _Start a local DIBS server for testing_

For local experimentation and development only, the script [`run-server`](run-server) can be used to start a local copy of the server.  It assumes you are in the current directory, and it takes a few arguments for controlling its behavior:

```sh
./run-server -h
```

In a real installation, DIBS needs the web server to provide user authentication.  This is not the situation in a local development server, and so for demo/debugging purposes, the `run-server` command lets you tell DIBS that a specific user has already been authenticated.  Using the example user from above, you can start a local DIBS server in debug mode like this:

```
./run-server -m debug -u dibsuser
```

By default it starts the server on `localhost` port 8080.  Using the `debug` run mode flag changes the behavior in various useful ways, such as to reload the source files automatically if any of them are edited, and to run `pdb` upon any exceptions.  (These would not be enabled in a production server.)

Note that `run-server` is **not intended for use in production servers**. For actual use, you must configure a web server such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org) to host the system. DIBS comes with an [`adapter.wsgi`](adapter.wsgi) and an example [Apache conf file](dibs.conf-example) for this purpose to help you get started.


## General information

The docs are available online at [https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dibs/](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dibs/).  They are built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  The sources are kept in the [`docs`](./docs) subdirectory.  The [`README.md`](./docs/README.md) file in the [`docs`](./docs) subdirectory explains how to build and preview the documentation locally.


## Known issues and limitations

DIBS is in active development.  The current version was produced rapidly, and has a limited scope and streamlined design.  We continue to improve DIBS in various ways.

It is worth mentioning that DIBS does not (currently) implement a queue or wait list for loan requests.  This is a conscious design decision.  Queuing systems tend to lead to complexity quickly, and we want to delay implementing a queue until it becomes clear that it's really essential.  (After all, in a physical library, there are no queues for borrowing books: you go to see if it's available, and if it's not, you can't borrow it.)  Perhaps we can implement interfaces and behaviors in DIBS that avoid the need for a queue at all!
