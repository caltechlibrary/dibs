data_models.py: model object class definitions for the database

This uses Peewee (http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/), a small ORM that
allows writing database code entirely in terms of Python objects without
having to know much about SQL.

    '''Base PeeWee object model for all DIBS database objects.'''

    class Meta:
        database = database


class Item(BaseModel):
    '''An item available for borrowing through DIBS.

    Each item available for loaning out gets a separate Item object in the
    database.  We may allow more than one simultaneous loan of a given item,
    so that's why there's a num_copies field to represent how many copies of
    the thing we're allowed to loan.  The duration is set per-item because we
    could very well allow some items to be loaned out for longer periods than
    others.  Duration is in terms of hours right now.

    The fields for author, title, year, edition, and publisher are not
    strictly necessary for loan purposes. They are here to cache the values
    so that they don't have to be looked up when generating the /item page.
    FIXME: keeping this data introduces an opportunity for inconsistencies,
    if the source data in the LSP gets changed.
    '''

    # Explanation of the rationale for the barcode and item_id fields:
    #
    # 1. All LSPs used so far assign id values to item records.  We need to
    #    store this id.
    #
    # 2. Peewee automatically defines a field/database column called "id" on
    #    every object, but it manages that field specially and although you
    #    can avoid having it create "id" altogether, you cannot *both* avoid
    #    Peewee creating id *and* defining your own field named "id" for a
    #    different purpose.  If you create your own field named "id", the
    #    schema definition works but things break at run time.
    #
    # 3. We override Peewee's default primary key field name (id) to use the
    #    barcode as the primary key, because we also need to store the LSP's
    #    "id" value, and it's too confusing to have separate fields named "id"
    #    & "item_id" on Item objects.  Point #2 above explains why we must use
    #    something other than "id" for our LSP id field.  Thus: "item_id".

    barcode    = CharField(primary_key = True)
    item_id    = CharField()            # The LSP's own id for this item.
    item_page  = TextField()            # URL for item's page in LSP.
    title      = TextField()
    author     = TextField()
    year       = CharField()

    notes      = TextField()


class Loan(BaseModel):
    '''A current or recent loan in DIBS.

    Loans are currently stored in terms of a combination of item + user
    identity.  A user can have multiple items out; they just get represented
    as separate Loan object instances. Similarly, an Item can be loaned to
    multiple people, if there are multiple copies of the item.

    Loans periods could be represented as start + duration, but since we'll
    need to test against the end of a loan repeatedly, it's easier to store
    the end time here (in field end_time).

    Our policy is that users can't immediately check out the same item; they
    must instead wait a certain amount of time.  After a loan ends, the Loan
    object is not immediately deleted; instead, its state is changed, and the
    field "reloan_time" is given a value corresponding to the first moment
    when the user can borrow that item again.  Once the reloan time is
    passed, DIBS deletes the Loan object entirely.

    All time values are datetime objects in UTC.
    '''

    # Important: Peewee's DateTimeField is *not* time zone aware. If you hand
    # it a Python datetime value without a time zone, it will treat it as a
    # datetime object, but if you add a zone (e.g., storing a value like
    # datetime.now(tz = tz.tzlocal()) you will get string values. So, we store
    # all values as UTC and then convert to/from local time zone as needed.

    item        = ForeignKeyField(Item, column_name = 'barcode', backref = 'loanref')
    state       = CharField()           # String, either 'active' or 'recent'

    start_time  = DateTimeField()       # When did the patron start the loan?
    end_time    = DateTimeField()       # When does the loan end?
    reloan_time = DateTimeField()       # When can this user loan this again?


class History(BaseModel):
    '''Record an event, such as a completed loan.

    The History class is used to keep records of things for which we want to
    do basic statistics, such as which items are loaned out most.  It's a
    generic object class meant to be suitable for more than just loan data.
    The intended use of the fields is as follows:

      type:   what is the event? A short string like "loan".

      what:   if the event involves an item, this string holds the item
              barcode, else a short description of the thing affected

      start:  when did the even start

      stop:   when did the event stop

    what       = CharField()            # What is this about? (e.g. a barcode)
    start_time = DateTimeField()        # When did the event start?
    end_time   = DateTimeField()        # When did the event stop?


class Person(BaseModel):
    '''An authenticated user who is able to access DIBS pages.

    There are 2 layers of access control in DIBS when deployed in a web server:

       1) can an incoming user access any part of DIBS at all?
       2) can the user access staff pages, or only patron pages?

    Layer #1 is implemented in the web server environment, and the details of
    how it's done depends on the specifics of the installation.  As far as
    DIBS is concerned, it only cares about whether a user has been
    authenticated or not.  When a page or API endpoint is requested from
    DIBS, the request environment given to DIBS by the web server will either
    include a user identity (if the use has been authenticated) or not.  DIBS
    simply refuses access to everything it controls if a user identity is not
    present in the request environment.

    Layer #2 is implemented in DIBS itself.  DIBS uses Person objects to
    distinguish between people known to have staff access (i.e., who can
    access pages like /list), and everyone else.  When a request for a page
    or an endpoint comes in, DIBS looks for the user identifier in the HTTP
    request environment passed in from the web server, checks if that user
    is in the Person table, and checks if the user has a role of 'library'.
    If the role is 'library', access to staff pages is granted; if the Person
    entry doesn't have a role of 'library', the user is not shown links to
    the staff pages nor can they access the relevant endpoints.
