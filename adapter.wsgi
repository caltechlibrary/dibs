# The following sets the default directory to the current app's directory, so
# that imports and calls to config(...) work as expected.  It also prevents a
# confusing error of the form "FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory:
# '...../adapter.wsgi'" in the Apache or mod_wsgi logs.

# Notes:
#
# 1) In the function dibs_application() below, we set variable "base_url" on
# "dibs" (our application object).  Our application code in dibs/server.py
# relies on this being set.  It's set only once.
#
# 2) Mod_wsgi runs this .wsgi adapter with a clean environment; you cannot pass
# arguments to this wrapper. Mod_wsgi expects that you use a separate config
# file or alternative .wsgi scripts for different run-time configurations.
# That's okay, but it makes it difficult if you want to keep things simple
# and not use multiple adapter files.  So, the approach taken here is to have
# dibs_application(...) do a one-time operation to look for environment
# variables and/or settings.ini values that change some behaviors.  It sets a
# flag and skips that step on subsequent invocations.  This allows us to do
# some configurations based on environment variables and settings.ini files
# (instead of having different .wsgi files for different configurations), yet
# avoid the inefficiency of doing that at every invocation.  Our "run-server"
# script takes advantage of that: it uses mod_wsgi-express's ability to set
# environment variables, and sets debug & verbose options if requested.
#
# 3) Keep in mind that mod_wsgi will normally run multiple processes and/or
# multiple threads (depending on the server configuration), which means this
# module (adapter.wsgi) will be invoked multiple times.
